            You can find a gene by introducing in the textbox a gene name, locus name or part of it.<br>
            Egs: Pp3c1_10180V3.1, c1_10180V3, 10180
          </li>
          <li>
            You can find genes by key words from their annotations.<br>
            Egs: kinase, auxin, defense, heat
          </li>
          <li>
            When using more than key words genes will be found including any of the key words.<br>
            EG: for Cellulose synthase, genes will be found containing either cellulose or synthase in their annotations.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is possible to use double quote search to find both key words together in the gene annotations.<br>
            EG: "cellulose synthase" will find all genes including cellulose synthase in their annotations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Key word search is case insensitive
          </li>
